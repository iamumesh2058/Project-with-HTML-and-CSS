# Projects
This is the project I completed after learning HTML and CSS. During the development of this website, I had the opportunity to implement what I learned and also gained insights into aspects I was previously unaware of. I replicated a website from W3layouts.com as closely as possible. This exercise helped me understand CSS fundamentals and how to create visually appealing websites by manipulating CSS. It was a valuable learning experience that reinforced my knowledge and skills in web development.
